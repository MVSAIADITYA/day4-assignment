Certainly! Here are the detailed steps to set up a CI pipeline using GitLab CI or Azure DevOps on Azure for building, testing, and deploying a sample application:

Setting up a CI Pipeline using GitLab CI or Azure DevOps on Azure
Step-by-Step Instructions
Using GitLab CI
Part c: Define Pipeline Stages
1. Build Stage: Configuring the Build Process

Setup GitLab CI:
Ensure your project is hosted on a GitLab repository.
Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root of your repository.
Define Build Stage:
In the .gitlab-ci.yml file, add a job for the build stage.
The job should:
Specify the Docker image or environment in which the build will run.
Install necessary build dependencies.
Run commands to compile or build the application.
2. Test Stage: Running Tests during the CI Process

Define Test Stage:
Add a job for the test stage in the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
The job should:
Run in an environment where necessary dependencies for testing are installed.
Execute the test scripts or commands.
Report the results using GitLab CI's built-in features.
3. Deploy Stage: Deploying to an Azure VM

Configure Azure Credentials:
Store Azure credentials securely using GitLab's CI/CD variables feature.
Define Deploy Stage:
Add a job for the deployment stage in the .gitlab-ci.yml.
The job should:
Use Azure CLI commands to connect to the Azure VM.
Transfer necessary files to the Azure VM.
Execute commands on the VM to deploy the application.
Part d: Configure Build Triggers
4. Automatic Build Triggers

CI/CD Settings in GitLab:
Go to your GitLab project settings.
Enable "Pipelines" in the "CI/CD" settings.
Use repository settings to ensure that pipelines are triggered for specific repository events, like code push or pull requests.
Part e: Commit Your Changes
5. Commit Changes

Prepare Git Commit:
Add the .gitlab-ci.yml file and any other necessary configuration files to your local repository.
Write a descriptive commit message, e.g., Add GitLab CI configuration for build, test, and deploy stages.
Part f: Push Changes and Create Pull Request
6. Push and Create Merge Request

Push to Remote Repository:
Push your local changes to the remote repository on the feature-azure-ci branch.
Create Merge Request:
Go to the GitLab repository.
Create a merge request from feature-azure-ci to the main branch.
Add a description explaining the changes and intended CI/CD setup.
Using Azure DevOps
Part c: Define Pipeline Stages
1. Build Stage: Configuring the Build Process

Setup Azure DevOps Project:
Create a new project in Azure DevOps.
Use the Azure Pipelines service to create a new pipeline.
Define Build Pipeline:
Use the YAML pipeline configuration or the classic editor.
Define a stage for building the application.
The build stage should:
Specify the build agent or environment.
Install build dependencies.
Compile or build the application.
2. Test Stage: Running Tests during the CI Process

Define Test Stage:
Add a stage in the pipeline for running tests.
Define tasks to:
Install test dependencies.
Execute the test scripts or commands.
Report the test results using Azure DevOps test reporting tools.
3. Deploy Stage: Deploying to an Azure VM

Configure Azure Subscription:
Link your Azure DevOps project with your Azure subscription.
Store credentials securely using pipeline secrets and variable groups.
Define Deploy Stage:
Add a deployment stage in the pipeline.
Define tasks to:
Use Azure CLI or specific deployment tasks to connect to the Azure VM.
Transfer necessary files to the Azure VM.
Execute deployment scripts on the VM.
Part d: Configure Build Triggers
4. Automatic Build Triggers

Configure Triggers in Azure Pipelines:
In the pipeline configuration, set triggers to start builds automatically on specific events (e.g., on push to feature-azure-ci branch, pull requests).
Part e: Commit Your Changes
5. Commit Changes

Prepare Git Commit:
Add the pipeline YAML file or any configuration changes to your local repository.
Write a descriptive commit message, e.g., Add Azure DevOps pipeline configuration for build, test, and deploy stages.
Part f: Push Changes and Create Pull Request
6. Push and Create Pull Request

Push to Remote Repository:

Push your local changes to the remote repository on the feature-azure-ci branch.
Create Pull Request:

Go to the Azure Repos in Azure DevOps.
Create a pull request from feature-azure-ci to the main branch.
Add a description explaining the changes and intended CI/CD setup.good
