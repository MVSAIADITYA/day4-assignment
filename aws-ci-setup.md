Certainly! Here are the detailed steps to set up a CI pipeline using Jenkins on AWS for building, testing, and deploying a sample application:

Setting up a CI Pipeline using Jenkins on AWS
Step-by-Step Instructions
Part c: Define Pipeline Stages
1. Build Stage: Configuring Jenkins to Build Your Application

Setup Jenkins on AWS:

Launch an AWS EC2 instance with appropriate specifications for your Jenkins server.
Install Jenkins on the EC2 instance following Jenkins installation documentation for your operating system.
Access Jenkins through the web interface and complete initial setup.
Install Required Plugins:

Install essential plugins such as Pipeline, Git, GitHub, and AWS CLI.
Setup Jenkins Job:

Create a new Pipeline job in Jenkins.
Configure Source Code Management (SCM):
Use Git as the SCM and provide the repository URL.
Configure the credentials if necessary.
Define the pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) within the job or directly in the repository.
The script should:
Checkout the source code from the repository.
Set up the environment (e.g., install Python, virtualenv/venv).
Compile or prepare the application for the next stages.
2. Test Stage: Running Tests as Part of the CI Process

Define Test Stage in Pipeline:
Include a stage in the Jenkinsfile for running tests.
Ensure any dependencies for running the tests are installed.
Execute test commands using a testing framework (e.g., pytest for Python applications).
Record and publish test results using built-in Jenkins functionality (e.g., JUnit reports).
3. Deploy Stage: Deploying to an EC2 Instance

Configure AWS Credentials in Jenkins:

Add AWS credentials to Jenkins securely using the Jenkins credentials store.
Define Deploy Stage in Pipeline:

Include a stage in the Jenkinsfile for deployment.
Use the AWS CLI or tools like Ansible/Terraform for deployment automation.
The script should:
Connect to the target EC2 instance using SSH.
Transfer necessary files/binaries to the EC2 instance.
Perform steps to deploy the application (e.g., installing dependencies, restarting services).
Part d: Configure Build Triggers
4. Automatic Build Triggers

Set Up Webhooks:
Navigate to your GitHub repository.
Under settings, configure a webhook to notify Jenkins on code pushes or pull requests.
Configure Jenkins Job for Build Triggers:
In the Jenkins job configuration, set the trigger to "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling."
Part e: Commit Your Changes
5. Commit Changes

Prepare Git Commit:
Stage all changes (including the Jenkinsfile and any other configuration files).
Write a detailed commit message, e.g., Add Jenkins pipeline configuration for build, test, and deploy stages.
Part f: Push Changes and Create Pull Request
6. Push and Create Pull Request

Push to Remote Repository:

Push your local changes to the remote repository on the feature-aws-ci branch.
Create Pull Request:

Go to the repository on GitHub.
Create a pull request to merge feature-aws-ci into the main branch.
Add a description explaining the changes and the intended CI/CD setup.
